OpenAI teases Sora

OpenAI recently unveiled their most exciting update to date. [Sora](https://openai.com/sora) adds the horrific ability to generate up to a minute of video. 
While we have no details on what amout of time or money this costs, we can be sure that I'm dumb enough to make Hellbot make some videos.

I can already imagine the anarchy that Hellbot could bring to the stream. Between inserting irrelevant video ontop of my feed, fake advertisements, video rewards, made-up clips, slow-mo "replays" from multiple angles, and more, this is surely one of the final nails in the Hellbot architecture.

I look forward to braving this new Hell with you all. At least when OpenAI grants me access.

Mara preserve us..
