This is the story of Hellbot.

- 06/23/2012\: I create a Twitch Account. A life-long love of livestreaming begins.
- 02/12/2014\: TwitchPlaysPokemon revolutionizes livestream interaction. 
Also by now my friends have heard about Twitch and I'm not a giant weirdo.
- 12/14/2022\: [Nothing, Forever](https://www.twitch.tv/watchmeforever) demonstrates the power of Generative AI to create incredible stupidity at scale
- 03/04/2023\: Hellbot first takes shape as a simple Twitch Bot
- 10/07/2023\: I finally bother to put Hellbot on Github version control. Sheesh.
- 11/06/2023\: A website for Hellbot. This website!
- ??/??/????\: Hellbot becomes self-aware and goes on a rampage. There are no survivors.

Honestly, most of the story is in the [About](/about) section of the website. But I might do some blog-style write ups here.

You'll see posts courtesy of Hellbot pop up here as well as any channel rewards you might have claimed.
